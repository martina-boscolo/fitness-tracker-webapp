\subsection{Other Information}

%if needed write here other details about your Data Logic Layer that cannot be expressed directly through the ER schema

We have followed some rules during the implementation of the Database:
\begin{itemize}
\item Every Table must have the ID as the primary key.
\item If a table need to reference to another table should have an ID key that point to that table.\\
\textit{E.g.: The User Stats table that contains users entries for body measures must keep track the user who inserted the measure. The UserId refers as foreign key the User table.}
\item Other constraints can be made during the table creation.\\
\textit{E.g: In the User Stats Table an user can insert only a measure per day}
\end{itemize}
