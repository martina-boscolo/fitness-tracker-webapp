Our project (Fitness Tracker) aims to develop a Web Application for fitness enthusiasts, to let them have everything they need in one place.
Our system will be used to generally store all you need when you start your journey in the gym, going from your diet and your exercises schedule or your personal graph to keep track of your progress, to simply communicate with other passionate users to share advice and talk about anything you want gym related.
